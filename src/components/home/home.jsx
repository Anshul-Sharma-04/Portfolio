                        If our planet had been created a year ago, humanity would have existed on the planet for ten minutes,
                        and the industrial era would have started only two seconds ago. The internet would have existed for mere
                        milliseconds. In those milliseconds, humanity has created innovations at an unbelievable speed. 
                        The invention of technologies such as smartphones, social media, and machine learning has fundamentally
                        changed how we study, work, and live. And this rate of discovery is showing no signs of slowing down.

                        The fields of computing, artificial intelligence, and gene editing are skyrocketing. We truly live in 
                        exhilarating times -- yet not all is well. We face difficult concerns as a collective society, such as 
                        climate change, social inequality, and depression. I firmly believe that we need to adopt technologies to 
                        help combat such issues.

                        I am a full-stack developer with a Master's in Information Systems who design, build, write, and lecture. 
                        I've studied IT at universities in three countries, created solutions for some of the largest organizations 
                        in Sweden, performed talks for company leaderships', written an Amazon best-selling book, and composed viral 
                        articles.
